## Project Overview

In this project, we perform text classification on a dataset of restaurant reviews. The goal is to predict whether a review is positive (liked) or negative (not liked) based on the text content of the review. We use several machine learning algorithms, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, to build and evaluate classification models.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (can be installed using `pip`):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - nltk
  - scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the provided code cells in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
      ```shell
   cd Sentiment-analysis-of-restaurant-reviews
      
3. Install the required Python packages using the provided code cells in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (text_classification.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook:
      ```shell
   jupyter notebook text_classification.ipynb
2. Follow the code cells in the notebook to execute the following steps:
    - Load and preprocess the restaurant review dataset.
    - Train and evaluate text classification models using different algorithms.
    - View the confusion matrices and evaluation metrics for each model.
3. Modify the code and experiment with different parameters as needed.
